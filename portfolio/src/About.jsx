          I have recently graduated from the University of California, Irvine
          with a B.A. in Business Economics. I first discovered my passion for
          coding during my third year of college when I was first introduced to
          the concept of Web Development. With interest in a more technical
          area, I took an Intro to Programming Course in Python with the hopes
          of breaking into a Software Engineer role. However, due to both a lack
          of effort and getting sick with COVID, I failed that course. Though
          that was not the end of my journey as I picked up a Colt Steele's "The
          Web Developer Bootcamp 2024" course and started my self study journey.
          From then my passion for coding re-ignited as I sharpen my skills
          through not only self-studying but also participating in FOUR
          hackathons during my senior year. My goal is to return and pursue a
          second B.S. in Software Engineering as I look to break into the field.

          In my free time, I like to work on new projects and working with various
          APIs whilst exploring trending techs. I also enjoy mixing on the DJ
          board, lift weights, and play basketball!
